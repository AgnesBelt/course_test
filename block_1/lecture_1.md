  Something like this https://unfccc.int/resource/cd_roms/na1/mitigation/Module_5/Module_5_1/b_tools/WEAP/Training_Materials/WEAP_Tutorial.pdf but for 10hrs, and to build elements of a simplified national model with stylised data. (Or real better data if the participants have it).

- 20 hrs Reading  (100 pages background at pp5 per hour)
